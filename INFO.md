* **`ageis` (Spring Boot Project):** This is your main **Aegis Security API**. It's the central brain that will handle device registration and signature validation.

* **`backend-app` (Spring Boot Project):** This is your **Demo Bank Backend**. It will act as the middleman, pretending to be the "UCO Bank Backend" to show the complete end-to-end communication flow.

* **`sfe` (Android Project):**
    * **`sfe-client`:** This is your **Aegis Client SDK**. This library module contains all the security logic for the Android device.
    * **`app`:** This is your **Demo App**, which will use the `sfe-client` library and make calls to your `backend-app`.

Technically, the `Registration Key` would be generated by your **Aegis Security API** and provided to the bank's development team through a secure, out-of-band channel. Here is the most standard technical implementation:

1.  **A Secure Admin Portal:**
    You would build a simple, secure web dashboard (the "Regulatory & Admin Dashboard" from your design documents). This portal would be a part of your `ageis` backend service.

2.  **Onboarding the Bank:**
    When UCO Bank decides to use your service, you would create an administrator account for a trusted person on their technical team (e.g., their lead architect or security officer).

3.  **The Generation Process:**
    * The UCO Bank administrator logs into your secure admin portal.
    * They navigate to a section like "Applications" or "API Credentials".
    * They click a button like **"Generate New Registration Key"** for their specific application (e.g., "UCO Bank Android App v2.5").
    * Your `ageis` backend then generates a long, cryptographically random string.
    * **`technically`**: `String registrationKey = new BigInteger(256, new SecureRandom()).toString(32);`

4.  **One-Time Display:**
    The portal displays this newly generated key **one time**. The UCO Bank admin must copy it immediately. For security, the portal would not allow them to view the key again later. They can only revoke it and generate a new one.

5.  **Secure Distribution & Embedding:**
    The UCO Bank admin is then responsible for securely transmitting this key to their mobile development team. The mobile developers then embed this key as a string constant in the source code of the `UCO Bank App` before compiling and publishing it to the Play Store.
